# Fullstack Project: React.js Frontend and Express.js Backend with MongoDB

Welcome to fullstack project! This project showcases the integration of a React.js frontend, an Express.js backend, and a MongoDB NoSQL database. It's a powerful combination that allows us to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: I've built the user interface using React.js. This powerful library enables us to create interactive and efficient user interfaces that update in real time.
  
- **Backend**: server-side logic is powered by Express.js. This lightweight and flexible framework for Node.js makes it easy to handle requests, manage routes, and implement APIs.
  
- **Database**: For data storage, I've chosen MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. This non-relational database system is ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, giving us the flexibility to adapt and evolve  data structures as needed.

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: The React.js frontend provides a seamless and responsive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
  
- **API Endpoints**: Express.js backend defines various API endpoints that handle requests from the frontend. These endpoints allow us to interact with the MongoDB database and serve data to the client.
  
- **Database Interaction**: MongoDB serves as the data store for my application. We can easily create, retrieve, update, and delete data using MongoDB's flexible document-based model.
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
3. Similarly, navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
4. Set up your MongoDB connection by adding your MongoDB Atlas connection string to the backend configuration.
5. In the `frontend` directory, run `npm start` to start the frontend development server.
6. In the `backend` directory, run `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
7. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action!
